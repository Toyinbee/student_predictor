# üß† Detection of Psychological Health Issues and Student Performance using Explainability Models

This project predicts a student's **mental health status** and **CGPA performance** using machine learning models and provides explanations using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations).

It is built with **Streamlit** for easy interaction and visualization, helping students and stakeholders understand the reasoning behind each prediction.
